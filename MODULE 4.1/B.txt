What is OOP? list of OOP concepts.


Ans:-

OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It is a programming paradigm that is based
on the concept of objects. C++ is an object-oriented programming language that supports 
the creation of objects and the use of object-oriented programming concepts.


    In C++, an object is an instance of a class, which is a template or blueprint for creating 
objects. A class defines the properties and behaviors of objects, such as the data that an 
object contains and the functions that an object can perform.


    Object-oriented programming in C++ provides a number of benefits, including
encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Encapsulation is the process of hiding the 
implementation details of an object from other parts of the program. Inheritance allows a
new class to be based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and behaviors. 
Polymorphism allows objects to be used in different ways, depending on the context in
which they are used.

Overall, object-oriented programming in C++ allows for the creation of modular, reusable,
and maintainable code that can be easily extended and modified.

There are some basic concepts that act as the building blocks of OOPs i.e.

    1.Class
    2.Objects
    3.Encapsulation
    4.Abstraction
    5.Polymorphism
    6.Inheritance
    7.Dynamic Binding
    8.Message Passing
